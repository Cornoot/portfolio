        When you want to quickly gather data. One of the fastest ways to do this for your company is with a digital form
        that is specifically set to your needs. A form editor that you can use for every scenario that you encounter.
        The tool is global to use for many scenarioâ€™s. This is the biggest challenge we face with the Form Editor,
        understanding our varied target audience and understanding their needs for a digital form editor with logic and
        integrations baked into the experience. This could only mean one thing: scope creep.
